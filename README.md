## Instructions

You can either visit the page here https://tunikb.github.io/restaurant-reviews-app or clone/download a local version to your computer.
In the root folder of the project, start a simple HTTP server to run the page on your local computer. There are various ways to do this, an easy way however would be to use python. 
You can check whether you have installed python and which version you might have already installed by typing in ```python -V```. (In case you dont have python installed yet, check out the following page to install it: [python website](https://www.python.org).)
If you have python 2.x use the command ```python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000``` (or some other port, if that port is already in use). In case you have python 3.x installed, use the command ```python3 -m http.server 8000```.
